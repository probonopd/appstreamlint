# appstreamlint

A minimalistic lint tool for AppStream MetaInfo files for applications that checks that the essential fields of the AppStream MetaInfo 1.0 specification are there.

It roughly follows https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Quickstart.html#sect-Quickstart-DesktopApps.

This is meant to satisfy the requirements for AppStream MetaInfo files shipped inside AppImages, in the hope that future AppStream MetaInfo specification won't contradict the AppStream MetaInfo 1.0 specification and hence the 1.0 version of the specification can stay the requirement for AppStream MetaInfo files shipped inside AppImages indefinitely.
